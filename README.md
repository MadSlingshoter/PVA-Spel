# Solero

Welcome to the most competitive 2 player game you have ever played.

Jump up the map. Touching walls and ceilings allows you to jump in the air. Watch out for the lava.

Aim up and down and diagonally. Your gun shoots bullets that travel in a straight line. Shoot your opponents bullets out of the air.

Pick up the missile pack to be able to fire your very damaging missile until you die. Your missile is homing towards the closest player, including yourself. Use with care.

Click on the Solero logo to enjoy a practice single player map to practice your movement.
