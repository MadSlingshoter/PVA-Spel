# Solero

Welcome to the most competitive 2 player game you have ever played.

Jump up the map. Touching walls and ceilings restores your jump. Look out for the lava.

Aim up and down. Your gun shoots bullets that travel in a straight line. Shoot your opponents bullets out of the air.

Pick up the missile pack to be able to fire your missile until you die. Your missile is homing towards the closest player, including yourself. Use with care.

Open the pause menu with the escape key.
